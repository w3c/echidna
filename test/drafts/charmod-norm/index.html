        <p>The goal of the Character Model for the World Wide Web is to
          facilitate use of the Web by all people, regardless of their language,
          script, writing system, and cultural conventions, in accordance with
          the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/mission"><cite><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> goal of
              universal access</cite></a>. One basic prerequisite to achieve
          this goal is to be able to transmit and process the characters used
          around the world in a well-defined and well-understood way.</p>
        <div class="note"><div id="h-note3" role="heading" aria-level="4" class="note-title marker"><span>Note</span></div><p class="">This document builds on <cite>Character Model for the
            World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [<cite><a href="#bib-CHARMOD" class="bibref">CHARMOD</a></cite>]. Understanding the
          concepts in that document are important to being able to understand
          and apply this document successfully.</p></div>
        <p>This part of the Character Model for the World Wide Web covers string
          matching—the process by which a specification or implementation
          defines whether two string values are the same or different from one
          another. It describes the ways in which texts that are semantically
          equivalent can be encoded differently and the impact this has on
          matching operations important to formal languages (such as those used
          in the formats and protocols that make up the Web). Finally, it
          discusses the problem of substring searching within documents.</p>
        <p>The main target audience of this specification is <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> specification
          developers. This specification and parts of it can be referenced from
          other <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> specifications and it defines conformance criteria for <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
          specifications, as well as other specifications.</p>
        <p>Other audiences of this specification include software developers,
          content developers, and authors of specifications outside the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>.
          Software developers and content developers implement and use <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
          specifications. This specification defines some conformance criteria
          for implementations (software) and content that implement and use <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
          specifications. It also helps software developers and content
          developers to understand the character-related provisions in <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
          specifications.</p>
        <p>The character model described in this specification provides authors
          of specifications, software developers, and content developers with a
          common reference for consistent, interoperable text manipulation on
          the World Wide Web. Working together, these three groups can build a
          globally accessible Web.</p>

        <p>This document defines two basic building blocks for the Web related
          to this problem. First, it defines rules and processes for String
          Identity Matching in document formats. These rules are designed for
          the identifiers and structural markup (<a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a>)
          used in document formats to ensure consistent processing of each and
          are targeted to Specification writers. Second, it defines broader
          guidelines for handling user visible text, such as natural language
          text that forms most of the <strong>content</strong> of the Web. This
          section is targeted to implementers.</p>
        <p>This document is divided into three main sections.</p>
        <p>The <a href="#problemStatement">first section</a> lays out the
          problems involved in string matching; the effects of Unicode and case
          folding on these problems; and outlines the various issues and
          normalization mechanisms that might be used to address these issues.</p>
        <p>The <a href="#identityMatching">second section</a> provides
          requirements and recommendations for string identity matching for use
          in <span class="qterm">formal languages</span>, such as many of the
          document formats defined in <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Specifications. This primarily is
          concerned with making the Web functional and providing document
          authors with consistent results. </p>
        <p>The <a href="#searching">third section</a> discusses considerations
          for the handling of content by implementations, such as browsers or
          text editors on the Web. This mainly is related to how and why to
          preserve the author's original sequences and how to search or find
          content in natural language text. </p>

      <section property="bibo:hasPart" resource="#background" typeof="bibo:Chapter" id="background">
        <h3 resource="#h-background" id="h-background"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">1.3 </span>Background</span></h3>
        <p>This section provides some historical background on the topics
          addressed in this specification.</p>
        <p>At the core of the character model is the Universal Character Set
          (UCS), defined jointly by the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>
          [<cite><a href="#bib-Unicode" class="bibref">Unicode</a></cite>] and ISO/IEC 10646 [<cite><a href="#bib-ISO10646" class="bibref">ISO10646</a></cite>]. In this document, <dfn id="dfn-unicode" data-dfn-type="dfn">Unicode</dfn>
          is used as a synonym for the Universal Character Set. A successful
          character model allows Web documents authored in the world's writing
          systems, scripts, and languages (and on different platforms) to be
          exchanged, read, and searched by the Web's users around the world.</p>
        <p>The first few chapters of the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>
          [<cite><a href="#bib-Unicode" class="bibref">Unicode</a></cite>] provide useful background reading.</p>
        <p>For information about the requirements that informed the development
          of important parts of this specification, see <cite>Requirements for
            String Identity Matching and String Indexing</cite> [<cite><a href="#bib-CHARREQ" class="bibref">CHARREQ</a></cite>].</p>
      </section>
      <section property="bibo:hasPart" resource="#terminology" typeof="bibo:Chapter" id="terminology">
        <h3 resource="#h-terminology" id="h-terminology"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">1.4 </span>Terminology and Notation</span></h3>
        <p>This section contains terminology and notation specific to this
          document.</p>
        <p>The Web is built on text-based formats and protocols. In order to
          describe string matching or searching effectively, it is necessary to
          establish terminology that allows us to talk about the different kinds
          of text within a given format or protocol, as the requirements and
          details vary significantly. </p>
        <p>Unicode code points are denoted as <code class="kw" translate="no">U+hhhh</code>,
          where <code class="kw" translate="no">hhhh</code> is a sequence of at
          least four, and at most six hexadecimal digits. For example, the
          character <span class="qchar">€</span> <span class="uname" translate="no">EURO
            SIGN</span> has the code point <span class="uname" translate="no">U+20AC</span>.</p>
        <p>Some characters that are used in the various examples might not
          appear as intended unless you have the appropriate font. Care has been
          taken to ensure that the examples nevertheless remain understandable.</p>
        <p>A <dfn id="dfn-legacy-character-encoding" data-dfn-type="dfn">legacy
            character encoding</dfn> is a character encoding not based on the
          Unicode character set.</p>


        <p>A <dfn id="dfn-transcoder" data-dfn-type="dfn">transcoder</dfn> is a process that converts
		text between two character encodings. Most commonly in this document it
		refers to a process that converts from a <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-legacy-character-encoding">legacy character encoding</a>

        <p><dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" id="def_syntactic_content">Syntactic content</dfn> is any text in a document format or
          protocol that belongs to the structure of the format or protocol. This
          definition can include values that are not typically thought of as
          "markup", such as the name of a field in an HTTP header, as well as
          all of the characters that form the structure of a format or protocol.
          For example, <span class="qchar">&lt;</span> and <span class="qchar">&gt;</span>
          (as well as the element name and various attributes they surround)
          are part of the syntactic content in an HTML document. </p>
        <p>Syntactic content usually is defined by a specification or specifications and
          includes both the defined, reserved keywords for the given protocol or
          format as well as string tokens and identifiers that are defined by
          document authors to form the structure of the document (rather than
        the "content" of the document).</p>

          <p><cite>XML</cite> [<cite><a href="#bib-XML10" class="bibref">XML10</a></cite>] defines specific elements, attributes,
            and values that are reserved across all XML documents. Thus, the
            word <code class="kw" translate="no">encoding</code> has a defined
            meaning inside the XML document declaration: it is a reserved name.
            XML also allows a user to define elements and attributes for a given
            document, for example, by using a DTD. In a document that uses a DTD that defines an
            element called <code class="kw">&lt;muffin&gt;</code>, <span class="qterm">muffin</span>
          is a part of the syntactic content.</p>

        <p><dfn id="dfn-natural-language-content" data-dfn-type="dfn">Natural language content</dfn> refers to the language-bearing
          content in a document and <b>not</b> to any of the surrounding or embedded
          syntactic content that form part of the document structure. You can think
          of it as the actual "content" of the document or the "message" in a
          given protocol. Note that syntactic content can contain natural
          language content, such as when an [<cite><a href="#bib-HTML" class="bibref">HTML</a></cite>] <code class="kw">img</code> element
          has an <code class="kw">alt</code> attribute containing a description of
          the image.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="dfn-resource" data-dfn-type="dfn">resource</dfn> is a given
          document, file, or protocol "message" which includes both the <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-natural-language-content">natural
            language content</a> as well as the <a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a>
          such as identifiers surrounding or containing it. For example, in an
          HTML document that also has some CSS and a few <code class="kw" translate="no">script</code>
          tags with embedded JavaScript, the entire HTML document, considered as
          a file, is the resource.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="dfn-user-value" data-dfn-type="dfn">user value</dfn> is unreserved syntactic
        content in a <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#def_vocabulary">vocabulary</a> that is assigned by users, as distinct
        from reserved keywords in a given format
        or protocol. For example, CSS class names are part of the syntax of a CSS
        style sheet. They are not reserved keywords, predefined by any CSS specification.
        They are subject to the syntactic rules of CSS. And they may (or may not)
        consist of natural language tokens.</p>

        <p>A <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" id="def_vocabulary">vocabulary</dfn> provides the list of
          reserved names as well as the set of rules and specifications
          controlling how <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-user-value">user values</a> (such as identifiers) can be assigned in a
          format or protocol. This can include restrictions on range, order, or
          type of characters that can appear in different places. For example,
          HTML defines the names of its elements and attributes, as well as
          enumerated attribute values, which defines the "vocabulary" of HTML
          <a href="#def_syntactic_content" class="termref">syntactic content</a>.
		Another example would be ECMAScript, which restricts the range of
		characters that can appear at the start or in the body of an identifier
		or variable name. It applies different rules for other cases, such as to
		the values of string literals.</p>

        <p>A <dfn id="dfn-grapheme" data-dfn-type="dfn">grapheme</dfn> is a sequence of
          one or more Unicode characters in a visual representation of some text
          that a typical user would perceive as being a single unit (<q>character</q>).
          Graphemes are important for a number of text operations such as
          sorting or text selection, so it is necessary to be able to compute
          the boundaries between each user-perceived character. Unicode defines
          the default mechanism for computing graphemes in <cite>Unicode
            Standard Annex #29: Text Segmentation</cite> [<cite><a href="#bib-UAX29" class="bibref">UAX29</a></cite>] and calls
          this approximation a <dfn id="dfn-grapheme-cluster" data-dfn-type="dfn">grapheme cluster</dfn>. There are two types
          of default grapheme cluster defined. Unless otherwise noted, grapheme
          cluster in this document refers to an extended default grapheme
          cluster. (A discussion of grapheme clusters is also given in Section 2
           of the <cite>Unicode Standard</cite>, [<cite><a href="#bib-Unicode" class="bibref">Unicode</a></cite>]. Cf. near the end of
           <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/ch02.pdf">Section 2.11</a>
           in version 8.0 of The Unicode Standard)</p>
        <p>Because different natural languages have different needs, grapheme clusters
          can also sometimes require tailoring. For example, a Slovak user might
          wish to treat the default pair of grapheme clusters "ch" as a single
          grapheme cluster. Note that the interaction between the language of
          string content and the end-user's preferences might be complex.</p>
        <aside class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 2</span></div>
          <p>The Hindi word for Unicode <q>यूनिकोड</q> is composed of a

              U+094B U+0921</span>). However, most users would identify this
            word as containing four units of text—यू, नि, को, and ड. Each of the
            first three graphemes consists of two characters: a syllable and a
            modifying vowel character. So the word contains seven Unicode
            characters, but only four graphemes.</p>

      <p>The Web is primarily made up of document formats and protocols based on
        character data. These formats or protocols can be viewed as a set of
        text files (<a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-resource" data-lt="resource">resources</a>) that include some form
        of structural markup or <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#def_syntactic_content">syntactic content</a>. Processing such syntactic content or document data requires
        string-based operations such as matching (including regular expressions), indexing, searching, sorting,
        and so forth.</p>
      <p>Users, particularly implementers, sometimes have naïve expectations regarding the matching or non-matching
        of similar strings or of the efficacy of different transformations they might apply to text, particularly to
        syntactic content, but including many types of text processing on the Web.</p>
      <p>Because fundamentally the Web is sensitive to the different ways in which text might be represented in a
        document, failing to consider the different ways in which the same text can be represented can confuse
        users or cause unexpected or frustrating results. In the sections below, this document examines the different
        types of text variation that affect both user perception of text on the Web and the string processing on which
        the Web relies.</p>

        <p>Some scripts and writing systems make a distinction between UPPER,
          lower, and Title case characters. Most scripts, such as the Brahmic
          scripts of India, the Arabic script, and the non-Latin scripts used to
          write Chinese, Japanese, or Korean do not have a case distinction, but
          some important ones do. Examples of such scripts include the Latin
          script used in the majority of this document, as well as scripts such
          as Greek, Armenian, and Cyrillic. </p>
        <p>Some document formats or protocols seek to aid interoperability or
          provide an aid to content authors by ignoring case variations in the
          <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#def_vocabulary" data-lt="vocabulary">vocabulary</a> they define or in user-defined values permitted by the
          format or protocol. For example, this occurs when matching class names
          between an HTML document and its associated style sheet. Consider this
          HTML fragment: </p>
          <aside class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 3</span></div>
        <pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;span class="h&amp;#xe9;llo"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
</aside>
        <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">SPAN</code> in the stylesheet
          matches the <code class="kw" translate="no">span</code> element in
          the document, even though one is uppercase and the other is not.</p>
        <p><dfn id="dfn-case-folding" data-dfn-type="dfn">Case folding</dfn> is the process of making two texts identical
          which differ in case but are otherwise "the same".</p>
        <p>Case folding might, at first, appear simple. However there are
          variations that need to be considered when treating the full range of
          Unicode in diverse languages. For more information,
          <cite>[<cite><a href="#bib-Unicode" class="bibref">Unicode</a></cite>]</cite> Chapter 5 (in v8.0, <a href="">Section 5.18</a>)
          discusses case mappings in detail.</p>

        <p>Unicode defines the default case fold mapping for each Unicode code point.
         Since most scripts do not provide a case distinction, most Unicode code
		points do not require a case fold mapping. For those characters that
		have a case fold mapping, the majority have a simple, straight-forward
		mapping to a single matching (generally lowercase) code point. Unicode
		calls these the <code class="kw">common</code> case fold mappings, as they are shared by
		Unicode's case fold mappings.
         </p>
		  <p>In addition to the <code class="kw">common</code> case folding mappings, a few characters
		  have a case fold mapping that would normally require more than one
		  Unicode character. These are called the <code class="kw">full</code> case fold mappings.
		  Together with the <code class="kw">common</code> case fold mappings, these provide the
		  default case fold mapping for all of Unicode. This case fold mapping is referred to in this
		  document as <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" id="dfn-UnicodeC+F">Unicode C+F</dfn>.
         </p>
		  <p>Because some applications cannot allocate additional storage when
		  performing a case fold operation, Unicode provides a <code class="kw">simple</code> case
		  fold mapping that maps characters that would normally map to more or
		  fewer code points to use a single code point for comparison purposes
		  instead. Unlike the full mapping, this mapping invariably alters the
		  content (and potentially the meaning) of the text. This <code class="kw">simple</code> case fold mapping, referred to in this document
		  as <dfn data-dfn-type="dfn" id="UnicodeC+S">Unicode C+S</dfn>, is not appropriate for the Web. </p>

		  <aside class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 4</span></div>
		  <p>One well-known example of a 'full' case fold mapping is the character <span class="qchar">ß</span>
		  <span class="uname" translate="no">U+00DF LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S</span>, a letter that is commonly
		  used in the German language. The 'full' mapping of this character is to two ASCII letters 's'.
		  There is no 'simple' mapping for this letter. </p>
		  <p>Other examples can
		  be found in the Greek script, where several precomposed characters have multi-character
		  case fold mappings. For example, consider the character <code>U+1F9B</code> (<span class="uname" translate="no">GREEK CAPITAL LETTER ETA WITH DASIA AND VARIA AND
					PROSGEGRAMMENI</span>). This character has both a <code class="kw">full</code> and <code class="kw">simple</code> mapping:</p>
		  	<table style="width: 100%">

					<th>Full</th>
					<th>Simple</th>

				</tr>

        <p>Note that case folding removes information from a string which cannot
		be recovered later. </p>
        <p>Another aspect of case folding is that it can be language sensitive.
          Unicode defines default case mappings for each encoded character, but
          these are only defaults and are not appropriate in all cases. Some
          languages need case-folding to be tailored to meet specific linguistic
          needs. One common example of this are Turkic languages written in the
          Latin script.</p>
        <aside class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 5</span></div>

        <p>Sometimes case can vary in a way that is not semantically meaningful
          or is not fully under the user's control. This is particularly true
          when <a href="#searching">searching</a> a document, but also applies
          when defining rules for matching user- or content-generated values,
          such as identifiers. In these situations, case-<em>in</em>sensitive
          matching might be desirable instead.</p>
        <p>When defining a <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#def_vocabulary">vocabulary</a>, one important consideration is
          whether the values are restricted to the ASCII subset of Unicode or if
          the vocabulary permits the use of characters (such as accents on Latin
          letters or a broad range of Unicode including non-Latin scripts) that
          potentially have more complex case folding requirements.
        To address these different requirements, there are four types of casefold matching defined by this document for the purposes of
        string identity matching in document formats or protocols:
        </p><p><dfn id="dfn-case-sensitive-matching" data-dfn-type="dfn">Case sensitive matching</dfn>: code
          points are compared directly with no case folding.</p>
        <p><dfn id="dfn-ascii-case-insensitive-matching" data-dfn-type="dfn">ASCII case-insensitive matching</dfn>
          compares a sequence of code points as if all ASCII code points in the
          range 0x41 to 0x5A (A to Z) were mapped to the corresponding code
          points in the range 0x61 to 0x7A (a to z). When a vocabulary is itself
          constrained to ASCII, ASCII case-insensitive matching can be required.
        </p>
        <p id="uci"><dfn id="dfn-unicode-case-insensitive-matching" data-dfn-type="dfn">Unicode

        <p><a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-resource" data-lt="resource">Resources</a> are often susceptible to the
          effects of these variations because their specifications and
          implementations on the Web do not require Unicode Normalization of the
          text, nor do they take into consideration the string matching
          algorithms used when processing the syntactic content and natural language content later. For this
          reason, content developers need to ensure that they have provided a
          consistent representation in order to avoid problems later.</p>
        <p>However, it can be difficult for users to assure that a given <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-resource" data-lt="resource">resource</a>
          or set of resources uses a consistent textual representation because
          the differences are usually not visible when viewed as text. Tools and
          implementations thus need to consider the difficulties experienced by
          users when visually or logically equivalent strings that "ought to"
          match (in the user's mind) are considered to be distinct values.
          Providing a means for users to see these differences and/or normalize
          them as appropriate makes it possible for end users to avoid failures
          that spring from invisible differences in their source documents. For
          example, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Validator warns when an HTML document is not fully in

          <p>Unicode defines two types of equivalence between characters: <em>canonical
              equivalence</em> and <em>compatibility equivalence</em>.</p>
          <p><dfn id="dfn-canonical-equivalence" data-dfn-type="dfn">Canonical equivalence</dfn> is a fundamental equivalency
            between Unicode characters or sequences of Unicode characters that
            represent the same abstract character. When correctly displayed,
            these should always have the same visual appearance and behavior.
            Generally speaking, two canonically equivalent Unicode texts should
            be considered to be identical as text. Canonical decomposition
            removes these primary distinctions between two texts.</p>
          <p>Examples of canonical equivalence defined by Unicode include:</p>
          <ul class="dropExampleList">
            <li class="dropExampleItem"><span class="dropExample">Ç<span style="font-size:75%">
                  vs.</span>Ç</span> <em>Precomposed versus combining
                sequences.</em> Some characters can be composed from a base
              character followed by one or more combining characters. The same
              characters are sometimes also encoded as a distinct "precomposed"
              character. In this example, the character <span class="qchar">Ç</span>
              <span class="uname" translate="no">U+00C7</span> is canonically
              equivalent to the base character <span class="qchar">C</span> <span class="uname" translate="no">U+0043</span> followed by the
              combining cedilla character <span class="qchar">̧</span> <span class="uname" translate="no">U+0327</span>. Such equivalence can extend to
              characters with multiple combining marks.</li>
            <li class="dropExampleItem"><span class="dropExample">q̣̇<span style="font-size:75%">
                  vs.</span>q̣̇</span> <em>Order of combining marks.</em> When
              a base character is modified by multiple combining marks, the
              order of the combining marks might not represent a distinct
              character. Here the sequence <span class="qterm">q̣̇</span>(<span class="uname" translate="no">U+0071 U+0323 U+0307</span>) and <span class="qterm">q̣̇</span>(<span class="uname" translate="no">U+0071
                U+0307 U+0323</span>) are equivalent, even though the combining
              marks are in a different order. Note that this example is chosen
              carefully: the dot-above character and dot-below character are on
              opposite "sides" of the base character. The order of combining
              diacritics on the same side have a positional meaning.</li>
            <li class="dropExampleItem"><span class="dropExample">Ω<span style="font-size:75%">
                  vs.</span>Ω</span> <em>Singleton mappings.</em> These result
              from the need to separately encode otherwise equivalent characters
              to support legacy character encodings. In this example, the Ohm
              symbol <span class="qchar">Ω</span> <span class="uname" translate="no">U+2126</span>
              is canonically equivalent (and identical in appearance) to the
              Greek letter Omega <span class="qchar">Ω</span> <span class="uname" translate="no">U+03A9</span>.</li>
            <li class="dropExampleItem"><span class="dropExample">가<span style="font-size:75%">
                  vs.</span>가</span> <em>Hangul.</em> The Hangul script is
              used to write the Korean language. This script is constructed
              logically, with each syllable being a roughly-square <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-grapheme">grapheme</a>
              formed from specific sub-parts that represent consonants and
              vowels. These specific sub-parts, called <em>jamo</em>, are
              encoded in Unicode. So too are the precomposed syllables. Thus the
              syllable <span class="qchar">가</span>&nbsp; <span class="uname" translate="no">U+AC00</span> is canonically equivalent to its
              constituent <em>jamo</em> characters <span class="qchar">ᄀ</span>&nbsp;<span class="uname" translate="no">U+1100</span> and <span class="qchar">ᅡ</span>&nbsp;<span class="uname" translate="no">U+1161</span>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><dfn id="dfn-compatibility-equivalence" data-dfn-type="dfn">Compatibility equivalence</dfn> is a weaker equivalence
            between characters or sequences of characters that represent the
            same abstract character, but may have a different visual appearance
            or behavior. Generally a compatibility decomposition removes
            formatting variations, such as superscript, subscript, rotated,
            circled, and so forth, but other variations also occur. In many
            cases, characters with compatibility decompositions represent a
            distinction of a semantic nature; replacing the use of distinct
            characters with their compatibility decomposition can therefore
            cause problems and texts that are equivalent after compatibility
            decomposition often were not perceived as being identical beforehand
            and usually should not be treated as equivalent by a formal
            language.</p>

          <p>In the above table, it is important to note that the characters
            illustrated are <em>actual Unicode codepoints</em>. They were
            encoded into Unicode for compatibility with various legacy character
            encodings. They should not be confused with the normal kinds of
            presentational processing used on their non-compatibility
            counterparts.</p>
          <p>For example, most Arabic-script text uses the characters in the
            Arabic script block of Unicode (starting at <span class="uname" translate="no">U+0600</span>).
            The actual glyphs used to display the text are selected using fonts
            and text processing logic based on the position inside a word
            (initial, medial, final, or isolated), in a process called
            "shaping". In the table above, the four presentation forms of the
            Arabic letter <span class="uname" translate="no">NOON</span> are
            shown. The characters shown are compatibility characters in the <span class="uname" translate="no">U+FE00</span> block, each of which
            represents a specific "positional" shape and each of the four code
            points shown have a compatibility decomposition to the <span class="quote">regular</span>
            Arabic letter <span class="uname" translate="no">U+0646 NOON</span>.</p>
          <p>Similarly, the variations in half-width and full-width forms and rotated
            characters (for use in vertical text) are encoded as separate code
            points, mainly for compatibility with legacy character encodings. In
		  many cases these variations are associated with the Unicode properties
		  described in <cite>East Asian Width</cite> [<cite><a href="#bib-UAX11" class="bibref">UAX11</a></cite>]. See also <cite>Unicode
		  Vertical Text Layout</cite> [<cite><a href="#bib-UTR50" class="bibref">UTR50</a></cite>] for a discussion of vertical text
		  presentation forms.</p>
          <p>In the case of characters with compatibility decompositions, such
            as those shown above, the <span class="qchar">K</span> Unicode
            Normalization forms convert the text to the "normal" or "expected"
            Unicode code point. But the existence of these compatibility
            characters cannot be taken to imply that similar appearance
            variations produced in the normal course of text layout and
            presentation are affected by Unicode Normalization. They are not.</p>

          <p>These two types of Unicode-defined equivalence are then grouped by
            another pair of variations: "decomposition" and "composition". In
            "decomposition", separable logical parts of a visual character are
            broken out into a sequence of base characters and combining marks
            and the resulting code points are put into a fixed, canonical order.
            In "composition", the decomposition is performed and then any
            combining marks are recombined, if possible, with their base
            characters. Note that this does <strong>not</strong> mean that all
            of the combining marks have been removed from the resulting
            normalized text. </p>

              is defined such that each combining character sequence (a base
              character followed by one or more combining characters) is
              replaced, as far as possible, by a canonically equivalent
              precomposed character. Text in a Unicode character encoding form
              (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16) is said to be in <abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr> if it doesn't
              contain any combining sequence that could be replaced with a

          <p>Unicode Normalization reduces these (and other potential sequences
            of escapes representing the same character) to just three possible
            variations. However, Unicode Normalization doesn't remove all
            textual distinctions and sometimes the application of Unicode
            Normalization can remove meaning that is distinctive or meaningful
            in a given context. For example: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Not all compatibility characters have a compatibility
              decomposition.</li>
            <li>Some characters that look alike or have similar semantics are
              actually distinct in Unicode and don't have canonical or
              compatibility decompositions to link them together. For example, <span class="qchar">。</span> <span class="uname" translate="no">U+3002
                IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP</span> is used as a <span class="quote">period</span>
              at the end of sentences in languages such as Chinese or Japanese.
              However, it is not considered equivalent to the ASCII <span class="quote">period</span>
              character <span class="uname" translate="no">U+002E FULL STOP</span>.</li>
            <li>Some character variations are not handled by the Unicode
              Normalization Forms. For example, UPPER, Title, and lowercase
              variations are a separate and distinct textual variation that must
              be separately handled when comparing text.</li>
            <li>Normalization can remove meaning. For example, the character
              sequence <span class="qterm"><samp>8½</samp></span> (including
              the character <span class="uname" translate="no">U+00BD VULGAR
                FRACTION ONE HALF</span>), when normalized using one of the <span class="quote">compatibility</span> normalization forms (that is,
              NFKD or NFKC), becomes an ASCII character sequence that looks
              like: <samp>81/2</samp>.</li>
          </ul>

        <section property="bibo:hasPart" resource="#normalizationLimitations" typeof="bibo:Chapter" id="normalizationLimitations">
         <h4 resource="#h-normalizationlimitations" id="h-normalizationlimitations"><span property="xhv:role" resource="xhv:heading"><span class="secno">2.2.4 </span>Limitations of Normalization</span></h4>
         <p>Applying a Unicode Normalization Form, even the more <q>destructive</q> Compatibility (K) forms, does not
            guarantee that two identical-looking strings use, in fact, the same underlying Unicode code points. This is sometimes
            surprising to software developers and others who expect that Unicode Normalization will eliminate all encoding variation.
            Normalization is, at best, only part of a string matching solution.</p>
   		  <p>In fact, canonical normalization is not primarily about
		  appearance: it is about folding multiple ways of encoding
		  the same logical character or grapheme cluster to use the same code point sequence.
		  Two (normalized) <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-grapheme">graphemes</a> can still look exactly the same, but not
		  represent the same logical character.</p>
		  <p>One example of this are the letters <code>U+03A1</code> (Ρ), <code>U+0420</code> (Р),
		    and <code>U+0050</code> (P). These letters look identical in most fonts, but they are encoded separately as part of the
		    alphabets used in the Greek, Cyrillic, and Latin scripts respectively. Unicode Normalization
		    will not fold these characters together.</p>
		  <p>Similar examples of identical appearance (called a <dfn id="dfn-homoglyph" data-dfn-type="dfn">homoglyph</dfn>) can appear
		    even within a single script. <q>Confusable</q> characters, regardless of script, can present spoofing
		    and other security risks. For more information on homoglyphs and confusability, see [<cite><a href="#bib-UTS39" class="bibref">UTS39</a></cite>].</p>
		  <p>Finally, note that Unicode Normalization, even the <q>K</q> Compatibility forms,
		    does not bring together characters that have the same intrinsic meaning or function,
		    but which vary in appearance or usage. For example, <code>U+002E</code> (.) and <code>U+3002</code> (。)
		    both function as sentence ending punctuation, but the distinction is not removed by normalization.</p>

        <p>Most document formats or protocols provide an escaping mechanism to
          permit the inclusion of characters that are otherwise difficult to
          input, process, or encode. These escaping mechanisms provide an
          additional equivalent means of representing characters inside a given
          resource. They also allow for the encoding of Unicode characters not
          represented in the character encoding scheme used by the document.</p>
        <p>See also, Section 4.6 of [<cite><a href="#bib-CHARMOD" class="bibref">CHARMOD</a></cite>].</p>

        <!-- examples taken from S4.6 charmod

		<aside class="example">
		  <div class="example-header marker"></div>
		  <p>Some examples of escapes and includes:</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>HTML and XML define 'Numeric Character References' which allow both the escaping of syntax-significance
		  and the expression of arbitrary Unicode characters. Expressed as &amp;#x3C; or &amp;#60; the character '&lt;' will not
		  be parsed as a markup delimiter.</li>
          <li>The programming language Java uses '"' to delimit strings. To express '"' within a string, one may escape it as '\"'.</li>
          <li>XML defines 'CDATA sections' which allow escaping the syntax-significance of all characters between the CDATA
           section delimiters. CDATA sections prevent the expression of characters using numeric character references.</li>
		  </ul>
		</aside>


		-->

        <p>For example, <span class="qchar">€</span> <span class="uname" translate="no">U+20AC
            EURO SIGN</span> can also be encoded in HTML as the hexadecimal
          entity <code>&amp;#x20ac;</code> or as the decimal entity <code>&amp;#8364;</code>.
          In a JavaScript or JSON file, it can appear as <code>\u20ac</code>
          while in a CSS stylesheet it can appear as <code>\20ac</code>. All of
          these representations encode the same literal character value: <span class="qchar">€</span>.</p>
        <p>Character escapes are normally interpreted before a document is
          processed and strings within the format or protocol are matched.
          Returning to an example we used above: </p>
<aside class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 6</span></div>
        <pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;

  span.h\e9llo {
      text-decoration:underline;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;span class="h&amp;#xe9;llo"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
</aside>
        <p>You would expect that text to display like the following: <span class="héllo">Hello
            world!</span></p>
        <p>In order for this to work, the user-agent (browser) had to match two
          strings representing the class name <code>héllo</code>, even though
          the CSS and HTML each used a different escaping mechanism. The above
          fragment demonstrates one way that text can vary and still be
          considered "the same" according to a specification: the class name <code>h\e9llo</code>
          matched the class name in the HTML mark-up <code>h&amp;#xe9;llo</code>
          (and would also match the literal value <code>héllo</code> using the
          code point <span class="uname" translate="no">U+00E9</span>).</p>

        <p>Unicode provides a number of invisble, special-purpose characters
		that help document authors control the appearance or performance of
		text. Because these characters are invisible, users are not always aware
		of their presence or absence. As a result, these characters can
		interfere with string matching when they are part of the encoded
		character sequence but the expected matching text does not include them.
		Some examples of these characters include:</p>
          <p>The Unicode control characters <span class="uname" translate="no">U+200D Zero Width Joiner</span> (also known
        as <em>ZWJ</em>) and <span class="uname" translate="no">U+200C Zero Width Non-Joiner</span> (also known as
		  <em>ZWNJ</em>).
		Their original use was to control
          ligature formation— either preventing the formation of undesirable ligatures or encouraging the formation
          for desirable ones. However, their primary use today is control
		joining and shape selection in Arabic and Indic scripts. For example, ZWJ and ZWNJ are used in some Indic scripts to allow
		  authors to specify the shape that certain conjuncts take. See the
		  discussion in Chapter 12 of [<cite><a href="#bib-Unicode" class="bibref">Unicode</a></cite>].</p>
		  <aside class="example"><div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 7</span></div>
		  <div class="example-title marker"></div>
			  <p>The <span class="uname" translate="no">Zero Width Non-Joiner</span> is used in Persian to
		  prevent certain "normal" Arabic script joining. In these cases, the
		  character affects the meaning. For example, the word تنها ("alone") and the word تن‌ها&nbsp; ("bodies"
		  or "corpuses") are encoded as "<span class="uname">U+062A
		  U+0646 U+0647 U+0627</span>" and "<span class="uname">U+062A U+0646
			  <span style="text-decoration:underline">U+200C</span> U+0647 U+0627</span>"
		  respectively, the only difference being the ZWNJ in the latter word.</p>
		  </aside>
		  <p>Variation selectors (<span class="uname">U+FE00</span> through
		  <span class="uname" translate="no">U+FE0F</span>) are
        characters used to select an alternate appearance or glyph
        (see Character Model: Fundamentals [<cite><a href="#bib-CHARMOD" class="bibref">CHARMOD</a></cite>]). For example, they are used to select between black-and-white and color emoji.
        These are also used in predefined ideographic variation sequences (<span class="qterm">IVS</span>). Many
        examples are given in the "Standardized Variants" portion of the Unicode Character Database (UCD).</p>
		  <p>A few scripts also provide a way to encode visual variation selection: a prominent example of this are the Mongolian
		  script's free
        variation selectors (<span class="uname">U+180B</span> through
		  <span class="uname" translate="no">U+180D</span>). </p>
		  <p>The character <span class="uname" translate="no">U+034F Combining Grapheme Joiner</span>,
		  whose name is misleading (as it does not join graphemes or affect line
		  breaking), is used to separate characters that might otherwise be
		  considered a grapheme for the purposes of sorting or to provide a
		  means of maintaing certain textual distinctions when applying Unicode
		  normalization to text. </p>
		  <p>Whitespace variations can also affect the interpretation and
		  matching of text. For example, the various non-breaking space
		  characters, such as NBSP, NNBSP, etc.</p>
		  <p><span class="uname" translate="no">U+200B Zero Width Space</span> is a character used to
		  indicate word boundaries in text where spaces do not otherwise appear.
		  For example, it might be used in a Thai language document to assist
		  with word-breaking. </p>
		  <p>The <span class="uname" translate="no">U+00AD Soft Hyphen</span> can be used in text
		  to indidate a potential or preferred hyphenation position. It only
		  becomes visible when the text is reflowed to wrap at that position.</p>
		  <p>In almost all of these cases, users may not be aware of or cannot
		  be sure if a given document or text string has included or omitted one
		  of these characters. Because text matching depends on matching the
		  underlying codepoints, variation in the encoding of the text due to
		  these markers can cause matches that ought to succeed to mysteriously
		  fail (from the point of view of the user).</p>

        <p>For example, <span class="qchar">€</span> (<span class="uname" translate="no">U+20AC

          in the <code class="kw">UTF-8</code> character encoding. This same
          character is encoded as the byte sequence <code>0x80</code> in the
          legacy character encoding <code class="kw">windows-1252</code>.
          (Other legacy character encodings may not provide any byte sequence to
          encode the character.)</p>
        <p>Specifications mainly address these resulting variations by
          considering each document to be a sequence of Unicode characters after
          converting from the document's character encoding (be it a legacy

          byte sequences to Unicode. So the byte sequence <code>0x80.60</code>

        Unicode Normalization Form C. For most legacy character encodings, it
          is possible to construct a normalizing transcoder (by using any
          transcoder followed by a normalizer); it is not possible to do so if
          the <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-legacy-character-encoding">legacy character encoding</a>'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/REC-charmod-20050215/#def-repertoire">repertoire</a>
          contains characters not represented in Unicode.</p>

        <p>Previous versions of this document recommended the use of a <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-normalizing-transcoder">normalizing transcoder</a> when mapping from a
        legacy character encoding to Unicode. Normalizing transcoders are expected to produce only character sequences in
        Unicode Normalization Form C (<abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr>), although the resulting character sequence might still be partially
        de-normalized (for example, if it begins with a combining mark).</p>

        <p>It turns out that, while most transcoders used on the Web produce Normalization Form C as their output,
        several do not. The difference is important if the transcoder is to be round-trip
        compatible with the source legacy character encoding or consistent with the transcoders used by
        browsers and other user-agents on the Web. This includes several of the transcoders in [<cite><a href="#bib-Encoding" class="bibref">Encoding</a></cite>].</p>

            that when providing text in a normalized form, there are different

          <p>For use on the Web, it is important not to lose compatibility
            distinctions, which are often important to the content (see Chapter

          <p>Among the remaining two forms, <abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr> has the advantage that almost

             This is necessary to preserve round-trip behavior and other character distinctions. Indeed, many
             compatibility characters in Unicode exist solely for round-trip conversion from legacy encodings.
             Earlier versions of this specification recommended or required that implementations use a
             normalizing transcoder that produced Unicode Normalization Form C (<abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr>), but, given that this
             is at odds with how transcoders are actually implemented, this version no longer includes
             this requirement. Bear in mind that most transcoders produce <abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr> output and that even those
             transcoders that do not produce <abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr> for all characters mainly produce <abbr title="Normalization Form C">NFC</abbr> for the preponderence
             of characters. In particular, there are no commonly-used transcoders that produce decomposed forms where

        <p>As described <a href="#definitionCaseFolding">above</a>, one
		important consideration in string identity matching is whether the
          comparison is case sensitive or case insensitive.</p>
        <div class="requirement">
          <p>[S] <a href="#dfn-case-sensitive-matching">Case sensitive</a> matching is
            <em title="RECOMMENDED" class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em> as the default for new protocols and formats.</p>
        </div>
        <p>However, cases exist in which case-insensitivity is desirable.</p>
        <p>Where case-insensitive matching is desired, there are several
          implementation choices that a formal language needs to consider. If
          the vocabulary of strings to be compared is limited to the Basic Latin
          (ASCII) subset of Unicode, ASCII case-insensitive matching <em title="MAY" class="rfc2119">MAY</em> be
          used.</p>
        <p>If the vocabulary of strings to be compared is not limited, then <a data-link-type="dfn" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-ascii-case-insensitive-matching">ASCII
            case-insensitive</a> matching <em title="MUST NOT" class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</em> be used. <a href="#uci">Unicode
            case-insensitive</a> matching <em title="MUST" class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be applied, even if the
          vocabulary does not allow the full range of Unicode.</p>
        <p><a href="#uci">Unicode case-insensitive</a> matching can take several
          forms. Unicode defines the "common" (C) casefoldings for characters
          that always have 1:1 mappings of the character to its case folded form
          and this covers the majority of characters that have a case folding. A
          few characters in Unicode have a 1:many case folding. This 1:many
          mapping is called the "full" (F) case fold mapping. For compatibility
          with certain types of implementation, Unicode also defines a "simple"
          (S) case fold that is always 1:1.</p>
        <div class="requirement">
          <p>Because the "simple" case-fold mapping removes information that can
            be important to forming an identity match, the "Common plus Full"
            (or "Unicode C+F") case fold mapping is <em title="RECOMMENDED" class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em> for Unicode
            case-insensitive matching.</p>
        </div>
        <p>A vocabulary is considered to be "ASCII-only" if and only if all
          tokens and identifiers are defined by the specification directly and
          these identifiers or tokens use only the Basic Latin subset of
          Unicode. If user-defined identifiers are permitted, the full range of
          Unicode characters (limited, as appropriate, for security or
          interchange concerns, see [<cite><a href="#bib-UTR36" class="bibref">UTR36</a></cite>]) <em title="SHOULD" class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> be allowed and Unicode

        </div>
        <p>Note that an ASCII-only vocabulary can exist inside a document format
          or protocol that allows a larger range of Unicode in identifiers or
          values.</p>

            protocol or format.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Case-sensitive matching is the easiest to implement and introduces
          the least potential for confusion, since it generally consists of a
          comparison of the underlying Unicode code point sequence. Because it
          is not affected by considerations such as language-specific case
          mappings, it produces the least surprise for document authors that

      <p>Many Web implementations and applications have a different sort of
        string matching requirement from the one described above: the need for
        users to search documents for particular words or phrases of text. This
        section addresses the various considerations that an implementer might
        need to consider when implementing natural language text processing on
        the Web <em>other than</em> that mandated by a formal language or
        document format.</p>
      <p>There are several different kinds of string searching.</p>
      <p>When you are using a search engine, you are generally using a form of
        full text search. <dfn id="dfn-full-text-search" data-dfn-type="dfn">Full text search</dfn> generally breaks natural
        language text into word segments and may apply complex processing to get
        at the semantic "root" values of words. For example, if the user
        searches for "run", you might want to find words like "running", "ran",
        or "runs" in addition to the actual search term "run". This process,
        naturally, is sensitive to language, context, and many other aspects of
        textual variation. It is also beyond the scope of this document.</p>
      <p>Another form of string searching, which we'll concern ourselves with
        here, is sub-string matching or "find" operations. This is the direct
        searching of the body or "corpus" of a document with the user's input.
        Find operations can have different options or implementation details,
        such as the addition or removal of case sensitivity, or whether the
        feature supports different aspects of a regular expression language or
        "wildcards".</p>

        <p>Searching content (one example is using the "find" command in your
          browser) generates different user expectations and thus has different
          requirements from the need for absolute identity matching needed by
          document formats and protocols. Searching text has different
          contextual needs and often provides different features.</p>

          (Searching and Matching) of [<cite><a href="#bib-UTS10" class="bibref">UTS10</a></cite>].</p>
        <p>One of the primary considerations for string searching is that, quite
          often, the user's input is not identical to the way that the text is
          encoded in the text being searched. Users generally expect matching to
          be more "promiscuous", particularly when they don't add additional
          effort to their input. For example, they expect a term entered in
          lowercase to match uppercase equivalents. Conversely, when the user
          expends more effort on the input—by using the shift key to produce
          uppercase or by entering a letter with diacritics instead of just the
          base letter—they expect their search results to match (only) their
          more-specific input.</p>
        <p>This effect might vary depending on context as well. For example, a
          person using a physical keyboard may have direct access to accented
          letters, while a virtual or on-screen keyboard may require extra
          effort to access and select the same letters.</p>
        <p>Consider a document containing these strings: "re-resume",
          "RE-RESUME", "re-résumé", and "RE-RÉSUMÉ".</p>
        <p>In the table below, the user's input (on the left) might be
          considered a match for the above items as follows:</p>
        <div class="overlarge"><table class="data">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">User Input</th>
              <th scope="col">Matched Strings</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>e (lowercase 'e')</td>
              <td>"re-resume", "RE-RESUME", "re-résumé", and "RE-RÉSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>E (uppercase 'E')</td>
              <td>"RE-RESUME" and "RE-RÉSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>é (lowercase 'e' with acute accent)</td>
              <td>"re-résumé" and "RE-RÉSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>É (uppercase 'E' with acute accent)</td>
              <td>"RE-RÉSUMÉ"</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table></div>
        <p>In addition to variations of case or the use of accents, Unicode also
          has an array of canonical equivalents or compatibility characters (as
          described in the sections above) that might impact string searching.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the letter "K". Characters with a compatibility
          mapping to <code>U+004B LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K</code> include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Ķ U+0136</li>
          <li>Ǩ U+01E8</li>
          <li>ᴷ U+1D37</li>
          <li>Ḱ U+1E30</li>
          <li>Ḳ U+1E32</li>
          <li>Ḵ U+1E34</li>
          <li>K U+212A</li>
          <li>Ⓚ U+24C0</li>
          <li>㎅ U+3385</li>
          <li>㏍ U+33CD</li>
          <li>㏎ U+33CE</li>
          <li>Ｋ U+FF2B</li>
          <li>(a variety of mathematical symbols such as
            U+1D40A,U+1D43E,U+1D472,U+1D4A6,U+1D4DA)</li>
          <li>🄚  U+1F11A</li>
          <li>🄺 U+1F13A.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Other differences include Unicode Normalization forms (or lack
          thereof). There are also ignorable characters (such as the variation
          selectors), whitespace differences, bidirectional controls, and other
          code points that can interfere with a match. </p>
        <p>Users might also expect certain kinds of equivalence to be applied to
          matching. For example, a Japanese user might expect that hiragana,
          katakana, and half-width compatibility katakana equivalents all match
          each other (regardless of which is used to perform the selection or
          encoded in the text). </p>
        <p>When searching text, the concept of "grapheme boundaries" and
          "user-perceived characters" can be important. See Section 3 of <cite>Character
            Model for the World Wide Web: Fundamentals</cite> [<cite><a href="#bib-CHARMOD" class="bibref">CHARMOD</a></cite>] for a
          description. For example, if the user has entered a capital "A" into a
          search box, should the software find the character À (<span class="uname" translate="no">U+00C0 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACCENT GRAVE</span>)?
          What about the character "A" followed by U+0300 (a combining accent
          grave)? What about writing systems, such as Devanagari, which use
          combining marks to suppress or express certain vowels?</p>
